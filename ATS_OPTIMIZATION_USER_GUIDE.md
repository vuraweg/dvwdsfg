## Understanding Your ATS Score

### Font & Text (10 points)

**What it checks**:
- Is your font ATS-friendly? (Calibri, Arial, Times New Roman, Verdana)
- Is body text at least 11pt?
- Are headers at least 13pt?

**Why it matters**: ATS systems struggle with fancy fonts and small text. Standard fonts ensure proper parsing.

**How to improve**:
- Use Calibri (default)
- Set body text to 11pt
- Set headers to 13-14pt

### Layout & Margins (10 points)

**What it checks**:
- Are margins at least 0.5 inches?
- Is it single-column layout?
- Is line spacing between 1.05-1.15?

**Why it matters**: Tight margins cause text cutoff. Multiple columns confuse ATS parsers.

**How to improve**:
- Use "ATS Optimized" or "Standard" layout
- Avoid "Compact" layout for ATS submissions

### Headings & Sections (10 points)

**What it checks**:
- Do you have all essential sections? (Education, Experience, Skills, Certifications)
- Are headers in Title Case? (Not ALL CAPS)
- Is contact information complete?

**Why it matters**: ATS systems look for specific section names. Missing sections hurt your score.

**How to improve**:
- Ensure Certifications section exists (shows "Available upon request" if empty)
- Headers automatically use Title Case in ATS template

### Content Formatting (10 points)

**What it checks**:
- Are bullet points under 120 characters?
- Are dates formatted consistently?
- Are job titles and company names on the same line?

**Why it matters**: ATS systems truncate long bullet points. Inconsistent formatting causes parsing errors.

**How to improve**:
- Use the Bullet Point Validator
- Keep descriptions concise and impactful
- Apply suggested shorter versions

### Keywords & Parsing (20 points)

**What it checks**:
- Cloud platform keywords (AWS, Azure, GCP)
- Methodology keywords (Agile, SDLC, CI/CD)
- API and technical keywords
- Role-specific skills

**Why it matters**: This is the most important category! ATS systems scan for keywords matching the job description.

**How to improve**:
- Review the job description for key terms
- Add relevant technologies to your Skills section
- Include methodologies in project descriptions
- Mention cloud platforms in your experience

### File Format & Compatibility (10 points)

**What it checks**:
- Is the PDF properly structured?
- Does it have text layers (not images)?
- Is the filename ATS-safe?

**Why it matters**: Image-based PDFs can't be parsed. Poor file structure causes reading errors.

**How to improve**:
- Always use the built-in export function
- Don't convert from images or scans
- Use the suggested filename format

## Pro Tips for Maximum ATS Compatibility

### 1. Match Job Description Keywords

**Do this**:
- Copy 5-10 key terms from the job posting
- Naturally incorporate them into your experience
- Use exact phrases when possible (e.g., "REST API" not just "API")

**Example**:
Job posting mentions: "AWS, Docker, CI/CD pipeline, Agile methodology"

Your bullet point:
"Deployed microservices on AWS using Docker containers with automated CI/CD pipeline in Agile environment"

### 2. Use Action Verbs

**Strong verbs that ATS systems love**:
- Developed, Built, Created, Implemented
- Managed, Led, Coordinated, Directed
- Optimized, Improved, Enhanced, Streamlined
- Designed, Architected, Engineered

### 3. Quantify Achievements

**ATS systems give higher scores to measurable results**:
- ❌ "Improved system performance"
- ✅ "Improved system performance by 40% through code optimization"

### 4. Include Variations of Skills

**List skills in multiple formats**:
- JavaScript / JS
- Artificial Intelligence / AI / Machine Learning / ML
- Search Engine Optimization / SEO

### 5. Keep It Simple

**ATS systems prefer straightforward formatting**:
- ✅ Use standard bullet points (•)
- ✅ Use common section names
- ✅ Keep one consistent font
- ❌ Avoid graphics, images, or icons
- ❌ Avoid tables or columns
- ❌ Don't use headers/footers

## Common Mistakes to Avoid

### ❌ Using Creative Templates

**Problem**: Fancy designs with graphics, colors, or unusual layouts confuse ATS systems.

**Solution**: Use our ATS-Optimized template which uses a clean, single-column design.

### ❌ Embedding Text in Images

**Problem**: ATS can't read text in images or graphics.

**Solution**: Always use actual text, never screenshots or embedded images.

### ❌ Using Uncommon Section Names

**Problem**: "My Journey" instead of "Work Experience" won't be recognized.

**Solution**: Stick to standard names:
- Work Experience / Professional Experience
- Education
- Skills
- Projects
- Certifications

### ❌ Omitting Keywords

**Problem**: Your resume might be great, but without the right keywords, ATS filters it out.

**Solution**: Use the Keywords & Parsing checker to identify missing terms.

### ❌ Copying from Job Descriptions Verbatim

**Problem**: While keywords are important, blatant copying looks suspicious.

**Solution**: Naturally incorporate keywords into YOUR actual experience.
